* unless something happens thats interesting?? like an earthquake?? i dunno ... funny?? like my dad thinking an email from m s k c c, bc i shared the screenshot of the email with him, about verifying my home address to recieve a staff appreciation gift, sent at like 4 am, which i clicked on lol ... is a phishing email ... and then me saying ... noooo its not ... phishing, it cant be (cuz i clicked on it) ... then everyone at m s k c c getting an email later in the day that it indeed was not a phishing email and that we're going to get something in the mail for employee staff appreciation ... hope its a water bottle or a tshirt
* there was a big meeting that i had to say some things in, about some R code i had to write, and there was a PI who talked over me a bit, and i was telling my dad, that HE DIDNT talk over anyone but me ... like why me, it was bothering me like all day: i think honestly its bc i sound and look like im in my 20s, fine whatver, but i think it gives people some reason to talk over me like i dont know what im doing ... or im new or something ... i dunno how to fix this, im over it but its still annoying
* i watch other women in my team and other teams that are programmers ... i have to really learn this soft skill of sounding MORE i dunno assertive when i talk?? i already am, i dunno, like shut the fk up im making a presentation, listen to what i have to say, im not new to this, i spent 2 days on this R code ... then raise your fking hand if you have a question on zoom
