# RULES
* no posts from 9-5 work days
* BC im working
* unless something happens thats interesting?? like an earthquake?? i dunno ... funny?? like my dad thinking an email from m s k c c, bc i shared the screenshot of the email with him, about verifying my home address to recieve a staff appreciation gift, sent at like 4 am, which i clicked on lol ... is a phishing email ... and then me saying ... noooo its not ... phishing, it cant be (cuz i clicked on it) ... then everyone at m s k c c getting an email later in the day that it indeed was not a phishing email and that we're going to get something in the mail for employee staff appreciation ... hope its a water bottle or a tshirt
* there was a big meeting that i had to say some things in, about some R code i had to write, and there was a PI who talked over me a bit, and i was telling my dad, that HE DIDNT talk over anyone but me ... like why me, it was bothering me like all day: i think honestly its bc i sound and look like im in my 20s, fine whatver, but i think it gives people some reason to talk over me like i dont know what im doing ... or im new or something ... i dunno how to fix this, im over it but its still annoying
* i watch other women in my team and other teams that are programmers ... i have to really learn this soft skill of sounding MORE i dunno assertive when i talk?? i already am, i dunno, like shut the fk up im making a presentation, listen to what i have to say, im not new to this, i spent 2 days on this R code ... then raise your fking hand if you have a question on zoom
* m s k c c is like harvard or stanford, its a completely new experience for me, things happen at a very, very high level, which is fine, i can keep up, but its just a different experience, lots to do, lots to learn, people know so much
* i saw this today come in to my work email from genomeweb, i didnt log in so i didnt read the whole thing yet, https://www.statnews.com/2025/06/16/harvard-lab-to-be-financed-by-39-million-from-private-equity-firm-from-turkey/ umm what's wrong with this??? nothing ... i see no issue here
* in order to name my nextflow pipeline `rigel` or anything else, it has to be a relatable acronym, so i gotta think of something ðŸ˜¬
* my work github account is not working correctly, so i have to email or call m s k c c help desk which is fun bc theyre so nice ðŸ¥º
* guess who is doing well at workkk, according to my manager just now, alhamdulillah, BUT its still a lot of work, lots of questions to claude ai and code and cancer and papers, so its a little tiring sometimes, but im doing well and it feels good to like fit in and do well
* prolly gonna sleep early, have to wake up a little early ðŸ¥± ordered something from sephora last week ... a dual ended lip liner and i forgottt to even open the box been so busy
* i think im gonna get lip filler next year, i want to really think about it, i know i dont need it but im just so bored
* why is life so difficult ... i think ill call the plastic surgeon in my town that does it and find out more about it this week, then i can decide what to do -- i dont need it but im so bored, its temporary it lasts like ~6 months sooooo
* i want to look like a more put together person, where someone assumes im an interesting person, like i travel or something, but i dont do any of that lol my brother saw some lady at the short hills mall who clearly had a lot of plastic surgery done and im like yeah she looks like she has an interesting ass life, like shes an interesting person, whats wrong with that
