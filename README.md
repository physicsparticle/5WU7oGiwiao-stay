* no scheduled seminars and no scheduled didactics in the summer
* most scheduled meetings -> canceled
* nobody call me, txt me, im unavailable
* im not even getting my realid, i legit dont care, im not leaving nj and if i am its only to go to nyc, thats it


# RULES
* no posts from 9-5 work days
* BC im working
* no discussion of anything IP/internal/project specifics/code etc.
* note to self: things get out of hand on github after 10pm maybe just go to bed early

* unless something happens thats interesting?? like an earthquake?? i dunno ... funny?? like my dad thinking an email from m s k c c, bc i shared the screenshot of the email with him, about verifying my home address to recieve a staff appreciation gift, sent at like 4 am, which i clicked on lol ... is a phishing email ... and then me saying ... noooo its not ... phishing, it cant be (cuz i clicked on it) ... then everyone at m s k c c getting an email later in the day that it indeed was not a phishing email and that we're going to get something in the mail for employee staff appreciation ... hope its a water bottle or a tshirt
* there was a big meeting that i had to say some things in, about some R code i had to write, and there was a PI who talked over me a bit, and i was telling my dad, that HE DIDNT talk over anyone but me ... like why me, it was bothering me like all day: i think honestly its bc i sound and look like im in my 20s, fine whatver, but i think it gives people some reason to talk over me like i dont know what im doing ... or im new or something ... i dunno how to fix this, im over it but its still annoying
* i watch other women in my team and other teams that are programmers ... i have to really learn this soft skill of sounding MORE i dunno assertive when i talk?? i already am, i dunno, like shut the fk up im making a presentation, listen to what i have to say, im not new to this, i spent 2 days on this R code ... then raise your fking hand if you have a question on zoom
* m s k c c is like harvard or stanford, its a completely new experience for me, things happen at a very, very high level, which is fine, i can keep up, but its just a different experience, lots to do, lots to learn, people know so much
* i saw this today come in to my work email from genomeweb, i didnt log in so i didnt read the whole thing yet, https://www.statnews.com/2025/06/16/harvard-lab-to-be-financed-by-39-million-from-private-equity-firm-from-turkey/ umm what's wrong with this??? nothing ... i see no issue here
* in order to name my nextflow pipeline `rigel` or anything else, it has to be a relatable acronym, so i gotta think of something ðŸ˜¬
* my work github account is not working correctly, so i have to email or call m s k c c help desk which is fun bc theyre so nice ðŸ¥º
* guess who is doing well at workkk, according to my manager just now, alhamdulillah, BUT its still a lot of work, lots of questions to claude ai and code and cancer and papers, so its a little tiring sometimes, but im doing well and it feels good to like fit in and do well
* prolly gonna sleep early, have to wake up a little early ðŸ¥± ordered something from sephora last week ... a dual ended lip liner and i forgottt to even open the box been so busy
* i think im gonna get lip filler next year, i want to really think about it, i know i dont need it but im just so bored
* why is life so difficult ... i think ill call the plastic surgeon in my town that does it and find out more about it this week, then i can decide what to do -- i dont need it but im so bored, its temporary it lasts like ~6 months sooooo
* i want to look like a more put together person, where someone assumes im an interesting person, like i travel or something, but i dont do any of that lol my brother saw some lady at the short hills mall who clearly had a lot of plastic surgery done and im like yeah she looks like she has an interesting ass life, like shes an interesting person, whats wrong with that 
* "do you have an interesting summer planned?" nooo im literally working and then walking 10 steps, no more, to sit in the pool in the backyard, im not even driving to the beach, thats it, thats all im doing
* -- in my most chris tucker voice ever -- im glad yo ass isnt responding to emails bc i dont even wanna talk to you all summer ðŸ˜‚ everybody leave me aloneeee i just want to get a tan, lip filler and thats it
* some random person to me: "omg you look like an interesting person ... who are you" my response: "i dont even know who i am" ðŸ˜‚

* blehhh workkk
* couple of things to finish up, ehh ill finish around 5:30-ish, thennn prolly a nap, thennn gonna go out and get some matchaa
* gonna wake up a little early tomorrow to straighten my hair bc its just a mess, and i have to put my camera on thurs/fri for a couple of meetings
* have some things to do with ahhh i cant talk about it but need to write an R script to do something interesting
* the coffee is not coffee-ing today, literally not working
* i feel like the days where im a little tired, if there was just somebody outside my house selling c o c a i n e i would just seriously consider it ðŸ˜‡ lol -- im seriously joking, i would never do it, i dont like things that cause bigger problems than the original problem theyre prolly suppose to solve
* my highschool had a c o c a i n e problem and i thought that was all normal until i realized it wasnt
* im the plan maker for this weekend and my brother and his wife are coming up to nj from md so the plan is ... everyone dresses up nice, we go to a nice persian restaurant in north jersey ... sunday ... then do something else after dinner i dunno what
* ehh gonna log into work tomorrow morning then we're all going out to dinner hopefully persian
* day of catching up on things, got something to finish early morning tomorrow, my brother bought his 2006 z4 so we're going to get some coffee later with the top down
* theres a senior comp biologist i needed to ask something to but they were out today ... lol ... welp ... so ... anyway got a morning meeting to prepare for by waking up extra early tomorrow, i ordered turkish delivery for everyone for dinner, theres some pide with sausage and eggs i forgot what its called cant wait to try it, i just want the chicken soup tho, going out to get some coffee for tomorrow even tho its hot outside
* i had a dream about the great wall of china lol or some chinese wall, im going to txt my brother about my dream but he doesnt wake up until like 8:50 am bc hes in industry now, not academia lol
* the pipeline is still running for something i need to do today for tomorrow ... so for now ... we drink coffee ... bc its going to be a long day, bc actually it might not even get out of the pipeline today hmmm
* i think i see you in september 2025 ???
* i have two big things i want to finish today ... so then ill have a slightly lighter friday bc the big meeting is tomorrow, those presentations are like harvard stanford level presentations, theyre extremely good ... and then i can go to jummah with my dad during my lunch break ... thats the plannn for today/tomorrow ... then lip filler appt on saturday ... some studying on sunday
* they made my username a different variation of my first and last name on my work macbook pro than my like actual m s k c c username so it causes these issues sometimes with macfuse, which wont unmount without a restart, like the command just doesnt work, its just soooo annoying ... i have 3 big things to do today and ive completed .5 of them ... if i pace myself, ill finish everything and have a chill summer friday tomorrow to look forward to 
* alright, got a "Looks Good!" from the senior comp biologist ... big thing #1 -> completed, now starting big thing #2 which will take me to like 4:30-5pm, then ill do big thing #3 tomorrow morning, then the second half of friday i can play with claude code a little ðŸ˜¬ðŸ˜¬ðŸ˜¬


plan for thursday: ~day off~, juneteenth noo its not a day off oh well, weekend plans
* catch up on new yorker articles
* go to the gym, duh

lip filler appt: 28th @ 1 pm -- we all have to face our fears and do something new, i dunno ... lol, lets see what happens ... i think its so lame that i cant use my hsa/fsa, forgot which one i have, on aesthetic procedures bc m s k c c did put in a lot of money into my hsa/fsa account and so did i, but i cant use it for lip filler :( its like a legit Dr. that does it so thats good
* i think the vision is ... 2 syringes of lip filler ... https://espritcosmetic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Esprit_Tualatin_juvederm_Case1207_Lip-filler_All-Three.jpg
* i want it to look a little fake but not that much, like 20% fake bc any more than that, i feel like a person looks like they have problems going on in their life and i dont ?? im just bored
* i think its going to take two rounds of appointments to get it there WE WILL SEEEE
